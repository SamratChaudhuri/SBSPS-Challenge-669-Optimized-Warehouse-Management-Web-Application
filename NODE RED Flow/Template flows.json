India, having majority of\n   its deep seated roots embedded within the agro and it's subsidiary industries produces enough to feed a population \n   of around 140 crore and counting. India ranks second, to China, in it's annual Wheat production scale \n   (99.70 million tonnes.) The amount of Milk produced annually being 173.3 milion tonnes and that of Rice being\n   117.47 million tonnes.\n   Yet, India is ranked at 102 out of 117 countries as per the World Hunger Index, falling behind all of her neighbours.\n   There is a plethora of reasons behind this poor performance, ranging from miniscule to giganormous in size, but the \n   most essential of them all being the amount of food that is wasted in India, each year.\n   According to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization, a massive one third of the total amount of food produced \n   globally is wasted, which is worth over $750 billion. India currently ranks 7th in terms of overall food wastage.\n</p>\n<p>\n   Wastage causes a critically hampered demand-supply chain, with demands exponentially greater than supplies causing\n   food prices to skyrocket and therefore remain off of shelves for most of the people in the economically weaker sections\n   of the society.\n</p>\n<p>\n   Thus, we here at The Czar's have developed an ingenious way to curb our wastage, doing our bit for the society that we\n   live in. We shall be using Machine Learning as a tool for our endeavour to curb the wastage of perishables. By predicting\n   the amount of orders we might receive in the upcoming weeks (upto 10 weeks advance) from past trends of our business\n   dealings, we sincerely hope to cut down our wastage to a bare minimum.\n   \n</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/Insight%20graphics.png\" alt=\"Food index\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\">\n    \n\n</body>\n</html>","storeOutMessages":true,"fwdInMessages":true,"resendOnRefresh":true,"templateScope":"local","x":440,"y":200,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"58b525de.db1ebc","type":"ui_template","z":"6a795cea.764054","group":"e0194bf7.d08b38","name":"Essential Data","order":1,"width":0,"height":0,"format":"<p>\n    There are two excel sheets provided here for the understanding of the user of this web application.
